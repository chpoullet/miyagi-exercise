# Miyagi Exercise

## A script that asks for a user's input and responds with predefined strings to certain user inputs

## Learning outcomes

The miyagi exercise helped me understand the order in which if/elif must be placed (control flow). Furthermore, it required me to research for more complex methods.

On this project, I also had to use Git and GitHub. Repeated use of Git and GitHub is helping to further increase my understanding of both technologies.
